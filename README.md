# multi client chat application

This multi-client chat application was born in my 7th week of the Code for All_'s Full-Stack Development Bootcamp, designed to facilitate real-time communication between multiple users. The application is built using Java and is a great starting point for those interested in developing their own real-time chat applications. Feel free to use and contribute to this project to enhance its features and functionality.

Developing new features: 
- create and join chat rooms;
- see the online status of the users;
- in some chat room, send a message only for specific users.
